- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:/Users/chart/Documents/project/sp/scripts/preflight-release.ps1"` passed
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:/Users/chart/Documents/project/sp/scripts/test-mod-load.ps1" -DeepCheck` passed
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:/Users/chart/Documents/project/sp/scripts/test-debug-console-gating.ps1"` passed

Key output summary:

```text

## Real-Game Validation

### Main menu and start flow

- `MAIN_MENU -> open_timeline -> close_main_menu_submenu` passed
- `MAIN_MENU -> open_character_select -> select_character -> embark` passed
- `embark` now lands in `EVENT` (`NEOW`) rather than dropping to `UNKNOWN`
- After commit `26cd9b0`, `embark` action payload was revalidated and returned `screen="EVENT"`

### Continue / resume flow

- `continue_run` successfully restored an in-progress run multiple times
- Follow-up `GET /state` stabilized to the correct room state (`REWARD`, `MAP`, `SHOP`, etc.)
- After commit `26cd9b0`, `continue_run` action payload itself was revalidated and returned a stable non-`UNKNOWN` screen

### Combat and consumables

- Entered combat, played through combat state transitions, and used `run_console_command "win"` to accelerate validation
- `use_potion` was validated in real combat earlier in the session
- `discard_potion` remained available and state updates were consistent across non-combat rooms

### Dynamic combat metadata

- Regent combat was revalidated specifically for stars / star-cost behavior
- `Falling Star` correctly reported `star_cost=2` and became `playable=false` with `unplayable_reason="not_enough_stars"` after stars were exhausted
- `Stardust` was used to verify star-X behavior
- A protocol gap was found and fixed in commit `637deaa`: the state previously exposed `star_cost` but did not distinguish star-X cards from fixed-cost star cards
- After the patch, `Stardust` now reports `star_costs_x=true` while preserving the current resolved `star_cost`
- `Bullet Time` was revalidated against live combat state, and the MCP payload reflected in-combat cost changes after the card resolved

### Debug gating

- Debug console tooling was revalidated in commit `588d939`
- Direct mod HTTP action validation confirmed:
  - default release behavior: `run_console_command` returns `invalid_action`
  - development behavior with `STS2_ENABLE_DEBUG_ACTIONS=1`: command succeeds
- MCP server registration was also checked locally:
  - without the env var, `run_console_command` is not registered
  - with the env var, `run_console_command` is registered

### Reward flow

- `collect_rewards_and_proceed` passed
- Reward -> Map transitions remained stable after debug-fast-forwarded combats

### Shop flow

- `run_console_command "room Shop"` used to jump directly into the room
- `open_shop_inventory` passed
- `buy_card` passed
- `buy_potion` passed
- `buy_relic` passed
- `remove_card_at_shop -> select_deck_card` passed
- `close_shop_inventory -> proceed` passed

Observed state changes:

- gold decreased correctly
- purchased inventory entries were marked out of stock
- deck count changed after purchase/removal
- potion occupancy and relic count updated correctly

### Rest flow

- `choose_rest_option -> HEAL` passed after fix
- `HEAL` now restores HP and exposes `proceed`
- `choose_rest_option -> SMITH -> select_deck_card` passed after fix
- upgraded card state returned in `run.deck[]`
- `REST -> proceed -> MAP` passed

### Chest flow

- `open_chest` passed after fix
- nested relic collection is now surfaced through `chest.relic_options[]`
- `choose_treasure_relic` passed
- `CHEST -> proceed -> MAP` passed

### Event flow

- Standard event flow was already validated on `NEOW`
- Nested event combat validated with:

```text
run_console_command "event BATTLEWORN_DUMMY"
choose_event_option(1)
run_console_command "win"
choose_event_option(0)
```

Result:

- `EVENT -> COMBAT -> EVENT(is_finished=true) -> MAP` passed

### End-of-run flow

- `run_console_command "die"` passed
- `GAME_OVER` payload was present
- `return_to_main_menu` passed

## Findings

| Severity | Area | Issue | Repro |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2 | Start-of-run branch coverage | `deck_transform_select` / `deck_enchant_select` support was added to state recognition, but the final commit was not independently re-smoked on a dedicated transform/enchant branch after the patch landed | start a fresh run and force a transform/enchant card-selection branch |

## Conclusion

- Current status: `canary / gray release candidate`
- Not yet at "formal release complete"

Reason:

- The major gameplay chain is now largely covered and the biggest blockers found during real testing were fixed in commits `69ed5c2`, `26cd9b0`, `588d939`, and `637deaa`
- Static checks pass and most room chains now pass in live runs
- Debug tooling is now properly gated for development-only use
- Dynamic energy / star metadata is now more complete for agent-side decision making
- A final clean rerun on the latest commit is still needed for the remaining start-of-run transform/enchant selection branches

Recommended next step:

1. Re-run one fresh-run validation on the latest commit set
2. Force a transform or enchant deck selection branch and confirm `screen="CARD_SELECTION"` plus `selection.kind`
3. If those branches also pass, re-evaluate whether the project can move from gray release candidate to formal release
